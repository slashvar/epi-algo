# EPITA's Algorithmic Language Interpreter #

The EPITA's algorithmic language is educational programming language derived from Pascal using french keywords and providing the full set of expected features of a programming language (functions, procedures, pointers, array, records ... )

While originally of theoretic purpose, the language can be interpreted using `epi-algo`, a small interpreter (written in OCaml), to test a validate classical algorithm.

`epi-algo` also comes with a builtin graph loader that map graph described in text files to classical representation using adjacent matrix or a more dynamic version based on linked lists (vertex list and edge lists.)
